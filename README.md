Meteor Polymer TemplateEvent Test
=================================

Testing to see how to get meteor template events to work

### Background

Once you include webcomponents.js in the header, events that are set in a meteor template stop firing in Safari and Firefox.  Chrome still works.

Events set up via jQuery will still fire.

### Branches


* Header insert (main)

* Compatibility

* Package - TODO
